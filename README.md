# HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell Library 

The HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell library (`HPECOMCmdlets`) offers a comprehensive suite of cmdlets designed to manage and automate your HPE GreenLake environment. By leveraging this library, users can seamlessly interact with HPE GreenLake and Compute Ops Management services directly from the PowerShell command line, enabling efficient integration into existing automation workflows and enhancing operational efficiency.

Development is ongoing, and the library will be continuously updated to support new features as they are released by HPE.

## Requirements

- **Supported PowerShell Version**: 7 or higher. 

    > **Note**: PowerShell version 5 is no longer supported. 

- **Supported PowerShell Editions**: PowerShell Core version 7 or higher.

- **HPE Account**: An HPE Account is necessary to connect to the HPE GreenLake platform and any Compute Ops Management services.
     
    > **Note**: If you do not have an HPE Account, you can create one [here](https://common.cloud.hpe.com). To learn how to create an HPE account, see [Getting started with HPE GreenLake](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=a001.0.132en_us&page=GUID-497192AA-FDC2-49C5-B572-0D2F58A23745.html)

    > **Note**: To interact with an HPE GreenLake workspace and a Compute Ops Management instance using this library, you must have at least the ***Observer*** role for both ***HPE GreenLake Platform*** and ***Compute Ops Management*** service managers. This role grants view-only privileges. For modification capabilities, you need either the ***Operator*** (view and edit privileges) or the ***Administrator*** (view, edit, and delete privileges) role. Alternatively, you can create a custom role that meets your specific access requirements.

- **Supported authentication methodes**:
    - **Single-factor** authentication.
    - **Multi-factor** authentication (MFA) using **Google Authenticator** or **Okta Verify**.       
    - **SAML Single Sign-On** (SSO) but exclusively with **Okta**.
