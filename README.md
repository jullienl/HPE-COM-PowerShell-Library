# HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell Library 

The HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell library (`HPECOMCmdlets`) offers a comprehensive suite of cmdlets designed to manage and automate your HPE GreenLake environment. By leveraging this library, users can seamlessly interact with HPE GreenLake and Compute Ops Management services directly from the PowerShell command line, enabling efficient integration into existing automation workflows and enhancing operational efficiency.

Development is ongoing, and the library will be continuously updated to support new features as they are released by HPE.

## Requirements

- **Supported PowerShell Version**: 7 or higher. 

    > **Note**: PowerShell version 5 is no longer supported. 

- **Supported PowerShell Editions**: PowerShell Core version 7 or higher.

- **HPE Account**: An HPE Account is necessary to connect to the HPE GreenLake platform and any Compute Ops Management services.
     
    > **Note**: If you do not have an HPE Account, you can create one [here](https://common.cloud.hpe.com). To learn how to create an HPE account, see [Getting started with HPE GreenLake](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=a001.0.152en_us&page=GUID-497192AA-FDC2-49C5-B572-0D2F58A23745.html)

    > **Note**: To interact with an HPE GreenLake workspace and a Compute Ops Management instance using this library, you must have at least the ***Observer*** role for both ***HPE GreenLake Platform*** and ***Compute Ops Management*** service managers. This role grants view-only privileges. For modification capabilities, you need either the ***Operator*** (view and edit privileges) or the ***Administrator*** (view, edit, and delete privileges) role. Alternatively, you can create a custom role that meets your specific access requirements.

- **Supported authentication methodes**:

    - **Single-factor authentication** (username and password).

    - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** using Google Authenticator or Okta Verify.
        - To use MFA, ensure that the Okta Verify or Google Authenticator app is installed on your mobile device and properly linked to your account before initiating the connection process.
        - MFA with security keys or biometric authenticators is not supported. 
        - If your HPE GreenLake account is configured to use only security keys or biometric authenticators for MFA, you must enable either Google Authenticator or Okta Verify in your account settings to use this library.
        - For accounts with Google Authenticator enabled, you will be prompted to enter the verification code. 
        - For accounts with Okta Verify enabled, you will need to approve the push notification on your phone.
        - If both Google Authenticator and Okta Verify are enabled, the library defaults to using Okta Verify push notifications.

    - **SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)** is available for users with an hpe.com email address only.
       - This library supports SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) but exclusively for hpe.com email addresses. Other domains or identity providers are not supported for direct SSO authentication. 
       - To use SSO, ensure that the Okta Verify app is installed on your mobile device and properly linked to your account before initiating the connection process. 
       - Users leveraging SAML SSO through other identity providers cannot authenticate directly using their corporate credentials with the `Connect-HPEGL` cmdlet. 
         - As a workaround, invite a user with an email address that is not associated with any SAML SSO domains configured in the workspace. This can be done via the HPE GreenLake GUI under `User Management` by selecting `Invite Users` Assign the HPE GreenLake Account Administrator role to the invited user. Once the invitation is accepted, the user can set a password and use these credentials to log in with `Connect-HPEGL`.
    
    Note: You do not need an existing HPE GreenLake workspace to connect. You can create a new workspace after your first connection using the `New-HPEGLWorkspace` cmdlet.
