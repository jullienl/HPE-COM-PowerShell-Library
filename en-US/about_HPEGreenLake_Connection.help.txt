    about_HPEGreenLake_Connection

SHORT DESCRIPTION

    Explains how HPE GreenLake connection information is store in a global variable.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    The library utilizes three features:

    -- When using Connect-HPEGL, an [HPEGreenLake.Connection] object is returned to the caller

    -- The [HPEGreenLake.Connection] object is stored in a global variable accessible by any caller: $HPEGreenLakeSession

    -- When using New-HPEGLAPIcredential, a new apiCredentials object is created during the session and is stored in a collection of 
       application API credentials in $HPEGreenLakeSession.apiCredentials. An application API credential can be subsequently used to 
       execute API calls with an application instance 


GLOBAL CONNECTION TRACKING OBJECT

    After successfully authenticating to the HPE GreenLake platform, the [HPEGreenLake.Connection] object is added to 
    the global session tracker, $HPEGreenLakeSession.

    This object contains the following properties:

        -- session - Web session object containing information about the HPE GreenLake session, including cookies and credentials
        
        -- oauth2AccessToken - OAuth2 access token string returned by the API after successful authentication 
        
        -- oauth2IdToken - OAuth2 ID Token string returned by the API after successful authentication 
        
        -- oauth2RefreshToken - OAuth2 refresh token string returned by the API after successful authentication 
        
        -- userName - Email address that was authenticated with HPE GreenLake
        
        -- workspaceId - ID of the HPE GreenLake workspace 
        
        -- workspace - Name of the HPE GreenLake workspace   
        
        -- oauth2TokenCreation - OAuth2 token creation datetime value
        
        -- oauth2TokenCreationEpoch - Unix time since creation of the OAuth2 token
        
        -- userSessionIdleTimeout - HPE GreenLake user session timeout in minutes
        
        -- apiCredentials - Collection of application API credentials created during the session. Each API credential object contains 
           the following properties:
            -- credential_name - Name of the API credential
            -- application_name - Name of the application using this credential
            -- ccs_region - Region of the application using this credential
            -- application_instance_id - Instance ID of the application using this credential
            -- client_id - Client ID of the API credential
            -- client_secret - Client Secret of the API credential
            -- connectivity_endpoint - Connectivity endpoint of the application instance
