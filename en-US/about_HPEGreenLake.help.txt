SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PowerShell library for HPE GreenLake Edge-to-Cloud Platform
  

LONG DESCRIPTION

    HPE GreenLake offers a platform with a common set of cloud services that enables a consistent, cloud-qualified 
    customer experience. HPE GreenLake combines the cloud's simplicity and agility with its governance, compliance, 
    and visibility hybrid IT model. The HPE GreenLake Edge-to-Cloud Platform makes it easy for anyone with a minimum 
    cloud background to start, yet it is sufficiently robust for advanced users.

    This library allows PowerShell developers, IT automation engineers, or DevOps personnel to use the HPE GreenLake 
    Edge-to-Cloud Platform API to automate infrastructure policies and operations across multiple cloud platform resources. 
    
    Among many other operations, this library allows you to create users and assign roles, create a restrictive resource policy, 
    and fully automate device onboarding, assignment, subscription and tagging, generate API credentials for specific application 
    instances such as COM/DSCC/Aruba Central, and make subsequent API calls to these HPE GreenLake application instances. 

    The library can be used as either a CLI or using the core cmdlets to call from wrapper scripts. 
    
    A set of sample scripts are also provided, that show how to fully use the library.
